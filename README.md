# tempo-bot

For those who are tired to log their time on Tempo every day, and want to focus on their work, witness the **Tempo Bot ðŸ¤–**.

It's a CLI to log your time on Tempo automatically, based on your current tickets in Jira.

Run it every day using a cron-job or a cloud-function, and don't worry anymore about reporting !

> **Built with Rust.** Why ? Well, because I'm experimenting with Rust on my free-time (so the code may not be very idiomatic ðŸ™ƒ)

## Usage

```
Log your time on Tempo automatically, based on your current tickets in Jira.

```

## CLI Workflow

The CLI works as follows:
1. Fetch all the necessary info from Tempo and Jira (sprints, issues, already logged time)
2. Assign to each issue a "time score" (based on the story points, the status, the assignee, the priority, and a bit of randomness !)
3. Using these time scores, assign a time for each issue
4. Send these "worklogs" to the Tempo API
5. Done !
